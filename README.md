The regular expression pattern used for Mastercard validation in 
the validateMastercard and validateCreditCard functions is /^5[1-5][0-9]{14}$/. 
so the regular expression pattern is designed to validate a Mastercard number
by ensuring it starts with 5, followed by a digit between 1 and 5, and is then followed by 14 additional digits,
resulting in a total of 16 digits in the card number
